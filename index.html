    <p>
        Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a string), return the result of the two <br>
        numbers having that operator used on them.<br>
<br>
        a and b will both be positive integers, and a will always be the first number in the operation, and b <br>
        always the second.<br>
<br>
        The four operators are "add", "subtract", "divide", "multiply".<br>
<br>
        A few examples:(Input1, Input2, Input3 --> Output)<br>
<br>
        5, 2, "add"      --> 7<br>
        5, 2, "subtract" --> 3<br>
        5, 2, "multiply" --> 10<br>
        5, 2, "divide"   --> 2.5<br>
        Try to do it without using if statements!<br>
